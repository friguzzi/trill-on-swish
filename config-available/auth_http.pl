/** <module> Optional HTTP based authentication

Enable optional HTTP based authentication.

Note that lib/authenticate.pl  supports  both   HTTP  _basic_  and  HTTP
_digest_ login. Please make  sure  to   understand  the  security issues
involved with using authenticated access.  In a nutshell:

  - *Basic* authentication should only be used together with HTTPS as
    it exposes the user and password on the wire.
  - *Digest* authentication uses a challenge/response protocol to avoid
    exposing the password and a _nonce_ to avoid steeling a connection
    by reusing credentials.  The rest of the communication is insecure.

% Can be set to `basic` when HTTPS is used.  Using `basic` saves
% one round trip but requires HTTPS to avoid exchanging the password
