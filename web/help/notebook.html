<h2>About Prolog notebooks</h2>

<p>
A notebook is a list of <i>cells</i>. Notebooks are different from a
program with examples because they can <em>tell a story</em>, mixing
properly formatted text with programs and queries. The story is
<em>interactive</em>. The reader can edit program fragments and/or
queries and see the result. This makes notebooks particularly
interesting for writing <em>tutorials</em> as well as writing
<em>cookbooks</em> that document data analysis and transformation steps.
A Prolog notebook supports three types of cells:

  <ul>
    <li><b>Markdown</b> cells allow you to write text in the SWI-Prolog
    <a href="/pldoc/man?section=wiki">PlDoc</a> variation of markdown.
    <li><b>Program</b> cells contain a Prolog program.
    <li><b>Query</b> cells contain a Prolog query, operating
    on the nearest program above it.
  </ul>

<h3>Creating a notebook</h3>

<p>Creating and managing a notebook is supposed to be intuitive.  Below
we describe the first starting point as well as some less obvious
operations.

<ul>
<li>
To <b>add a new cell</b>, click the <a class="btn btn-info btn-xs"><span
class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></a> button and select the
desired cell type. The other buttons allow for deleting, copy/paste
and moving cells.

<li>
To <b>link to another notebook</b>, create a markdown cell and use the
markdown notation <code>[label](reference)</code>, e.g.,

<pre style="font-size:80%">
[All about lists](lists.swinb)
</pre>
<li>
To <b>link to file in the store</b>, create a markdown cell and use the
markdown notation <code>[label](myfile.pl)</code>, e.g.,
</ul>
