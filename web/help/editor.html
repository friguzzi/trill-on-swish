<h2>Navigating</h2>

<p>
If a token is related to one or more source locations, a <b>long click</b> (&gt;
500 millseconds) opens a menu below the cursor that allows for jumping to the
related location.  Currently, these are:

  <ul>
    <li>:- include(<a>file</a>).
    <li>a predicate all written as <a>name</a>(arg, ...).
  </ul>

<p>
Future versions are likely to add more options, such as jumping to caller
locations, open the documentation, listing predicates, etc.
